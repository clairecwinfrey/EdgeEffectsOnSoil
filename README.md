# EdgeEffectsOnSoil
This repository contains the scripts used to process 16S and ITS data from soils collected at the Savannah River Site (SRS) in May 2021. Scripts were written by Claire Winfrey, with substantial input on analyses from Noah Fierer and Julian Resasco. Below is a description of each script, listed in the order that scripts should be run to replicate results:

1. SRS_16S_Bioinformatics.R- This script demultiplexes raw 16S rDNA reads from the MiSeq, uses dada2 to trim, denoise, dereplicate, and merge reads, and assigns bacterial/archaeal taxonomy (using SILVA version 132).
2. SRS_ITS_Bioinformatics.R- This script demultiplexes raw ITS rDNA reads from the MiSeq, uses dada2 to trim, denoise, dereplicate, and merge reads, and assigns bacterial/archaeal taxonomy (using UNITE database, Oct. 5, 2021 release).
3. 16SExploratoryDataAnalysisAug2021.R - This script takes a first look at 16S MiSeq data. I look at sequence counts, rarefy, examine top classes and phyla, and look at ordinations bsaed on different EUs, different plant communities, etc. I repeat the ordinations and examination of top classes and phyla before and after removing rare species. I also investigate samples that seem to be outliers in ordination space. Finally, this script creates the cleaned up dataset used in all downstream scripts and analyses.
